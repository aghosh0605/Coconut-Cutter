# Coconut_Cutter-RUDRA
A trend going in South of India for making coconut cutter robot as it's difficult now a days to find a man to cut coconuts and in South there is too much coconut trees everywhere. So after our 1 months of hard work we finally did the prototype of the robot.

# Beaware of this
* Used Raspberry Pi4, Arduino to do the project.
* Serial folder contains Arduino code to upload in Arduino for serial Communication.
* Don't change any file and folder name and dicrectories structure.
* Put all the files in Pi and run the python file with python3.
* Change Pi ip address in HTML.
* You can change ports also for hosting in Python code.

# How to run :)
1. Pi setup
   - Install [**Motion camera**](https://programmaticponderings.com/2013/01/01/remote-motion-activated-web-based-video-surveillance-with-raspberry-pi/) and edit the configuration by `sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf` to get the camera feeds in webpage.
   - Install [**pyserial**](https://roboticsbackend.com/raspberry-pi-arduino-serial-communication/) for serial cmmunication between Pi and Arduino. We are using USB(UART protocol) for communication.
   - Install Flask with Pip `pip3 install flask`
   - Install GPIO with pip `pip3 install gpio`
   - Keep the HTML file in **templates** otherwise you will get an error.
   - If you change HTML page name, be sure to change it also in python code also.
   - For further webpage development with different CSS, javascript, HTML file in flask [see this](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/organizing.html)
